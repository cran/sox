\arguments{
\item{x}{Predictor matrix with dimension \eqn{nm * p}, where \eqn{n} is the number of subjects, \eqn{m} is the maximum observation time, and \eqn{p} is the number of predictors. See Details.}

\item{ID}{The ID of each subjects, each subject has one ID (many rows in \code{x} share one \code{ID}).}

\item{time}{Represents the start of each time interval.}

\item{time2}{Represents the stop of each time interval.}

\item{event}{Indicator of event. \code{event = 1} when event occurs and \code{event = 0} otherwise.}

\item{lambda}{Sequence of regularization coefficients \eqn{\lambda}'s.}

\item{group}{\eqn{G * G} matrix describing the relationship between the groups of variables, where \eqn{G} represents the number of groups. Denote the \eqn{i}-th group of variables by \eqn{g_i}. The \eqn{(i,j)} entry is \code{1} if and only if \eqn{i\neq j} and \eqn{g_i} is a child group (subset) of \eqn{g_j}, and is \code{0} otherwise. See Examples and Details.}

\item{group_variable}{\eqn{p * G} matrix describing the relationship between the groups and the variables. The \eqn{(i,j)} entry is \code{1} if and only if variable \eqn{i} is in group \eqn{g_j}, but not in any child group of \eqn{g_j}, and is \code{0} otherwise. See Examples and Details.}

\item{penalty_weights}{Optional, vector of length \eqn{G} specifying the group-specific penalty weights. If not specified, the default value is \eqn{\mathbf{1}_G}. Modify with caution.}

\item{par_init}{Optional, vector of initial values of the optimization algorithm. Default initial value is zero for all \eqn{p} variables.}

\item{stepsize_init}{Initial value of the stepsize of the optimization algorithm. Default is 1.}

\item{stepsize_shrink}{Factor in \eqn{(0,1)} by which the stepsize shrinks in the backtracking linesearch. Default is 0.8.}

\item{tol}{Convergence criterion. Algorithm stops when the \eqn{l_2} norm of the difference between two consecutive updates is smaller than \code{tol}.}

\item{maxit}{Maximum number of iterations allowed.}

\item{verbose}{Logical, whether progress is printed.}
}
\value{
A list with the following three elements.
  \item{lambdas}{The user-specified regularization coefficients \code{lambda} sorted in decreasing order.}
  \item{estimates}{A matrix, with each column corresponding to the coefficient estimates at each \eqn{\lambda} in \code{lambdas}.}
  \item{iterations}{A vector of number of iterations it takes to converge at each \eqn{\lambda} in \code{lambdas}.}
}
\description{
Fit a (time-dependent) Cox model via penalized maximum likelihood, where the penalization is a weighted sum of infinity norm of (overlapping) groups of coefficients. The regularization path is computed at a grid of values for the regularization parameter lambda.
}
\details{
The predictor matrix should be of dimension \eqn{nm * p}. Each row records the values of covariates for one subject at one time, for example, the values at the day from \code{time} (Start) to \code{time2} (Stop). An example dataset \code{\link{sim}} is provided. The dataset has the same format produced by the \code{R} package \pkg{PermAlgo}. 
The specification of arguments \code{group} and \code{group_variable} for the grouping structure can be found in \url{http://thoth.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/spams/doc-R/html/doc_spams006.html#sec27}, the same as the grouping structure specification in the \code{R} package \pkg{spams}.

In the Examples below, \eqn{p=9,G=5}, the group structure is: \deqn{g_1 = \{A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{1}B, A_{2}B\},} \deqn{g_2  = \{B, A_{1}B, A_{2}B, C_{1}B, C_{2}B\},} \deqn{g_3  = \{A_{1}B, A_{2}B\},} \deqn{g_4  = \{C_1, C_2, C_{1}B, C_{2}B\},} \deqn{g_5  = \{C_{1}B, C_{2}B\}.}

where \eqn{g_3} is a subset of \eqn{g_1} and \eqn{g_2}, and \eqn{g_5} is a subset of \eqn{g_2} and \eqn{g_4}.
